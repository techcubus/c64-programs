Old adventures in C64 programming.

I'm not sure how to make these readable vs drag and drop to your favorite emulator, so I'm expirementing with extra readability that breaks C64 compatibility. Extra line breaks would need to be removed and the C64 has an 80 byte line limit that can result in untokenized lines being longer than 80 bytes and not possible to type without using the tokens directly. If anyone has advice on this subject, I would love to hear it.

The primary purpose of this repo is contemplation, so getting things to work might require a bit of effort on your part. There's a good possibility I will change my mind about including extra linebreaks...

Bug reports will be found amusing, but also considered seriously.
